## Amazon Inspector Network Reachability Workshop

The workshop will demonstrate how you can validate your network configuration without needing to have a deep networking background by using Inspector's Network Reachability report. You will learn how this report can help them find misconfigurations in the architecture or behaviors they might not have expected. The workshop will finish with using the Network Reachability report findings integrated with other Security Services to remediate these issues.
